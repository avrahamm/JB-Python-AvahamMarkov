Solution doesn't work properly, </br>
there is bug I didn't solve. </br>
Yet you can look at pseudo code idea. </br>
to run :
node test.js

</br>
Later, I fixed the bug and created 'fixed-solution' branch. </br>
it works with example inputs. </br>
You can take a look on that branch, </br>
When on main branch, </br>
git branch -f fixed-solution origin/fixed-solution </br>
git checkout fixed-solution
